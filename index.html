"Description":"Lucky Patcher is an android program that allows you to use the full version of many applications without buying a license. It's no secret that most games and utilities are only available in demos. And in order to use all possible functions, you need to purchase a key. But now you can bypass the system and gain all the privileges without spending your own money.\n\nAfter installation, the program will scan all available applications on the device and display their full list. In the upper part, those of them (and highlighted in color) that are available for 'treatment from the license' will be marked. It will be pleasant also that thanks to Lucky Patcher there will be an opportunity to launch in offline those applications which earlier demanded connection to the Internet.\n\nEasy control, intuitive interface - these are the parameters taken by the developers as a basis. Scanning applications takes a minimum of time, like applying a patch.",

"Description":"Most game modification tools require root access to Android phones. The X8 Sandbox is a tool that provides root access to applications commonly used to edit games. Essentially, this application is designed for mobile game penetration testing.\n\nThe X8 Sandbox allows you to install apps that require rooting without rooting the device. Because rooting your phone is not good for your device's warranty.\n\nThis application creates a virtual area to run applications that require root privileges. This is a very simple tool that anyone can use without changing anything on your phone. So no need to worry about using it on your phone.\n\nA virtual machine is a program that works like a virtual computer. It runs on the current operating system - the host operating system - and makes virtual hardware available for the guest operating system. Guest operating systems, like other machine programs, run under the windows of the host operating system. For guest operating systems, the virtual machine is displayed as a real physical machine.\n\nYou can install multiple virtual machines on a real machine and are limited only by the available storage space. Once you have multiple operating systems installed, you can open the Virtual Machine program and select the virtual machine you want to start, start the guest operating system, and run it in the Host Operating System window, or run it in full screen mode.",
